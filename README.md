# CA_Wolfram_Cplusplus
Simple Wolfram automaton in C++

Currently only using the console.
You can input the rule number and it prints the correct pattern. The one piece of code I'm actually happy with.

ToDo:

-seperate everything into functions

-make the code for the new generation more efficient
